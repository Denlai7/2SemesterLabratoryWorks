So I was trying to add some front end with sfml but due to the fact that I am doing everything on the online interpretor its kinda impoosible.
Buuut I am a dedicated student so I got this thingy Code::Blocks and it sucks as hell but once more due to strange stuff with vs I still needed to use that stuff
And I spend some time trying to build it with sfml files I downloaded earlier and amazingly failed haha...
so its without frontend, just some random stuff that kinda covers the task, I am even dunno if its enough
